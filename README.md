# Rust Wasm WebRTC BitTorent-like file sharing example (WIP)

## About

An example of BitTorrent-like file sharing in a browser using Rust/Wasm and WebRTC.
At the moment, the example is extremely CPU intensive, makes poor use of Peer-To-Peer interactions, and has poor block selection algorithms.

## WIP Branch

This is a work in progress branch.
For a more stable version, use the master branch.

## Crates

- client: file sharing example ui,
- peer: file sharing library,
- server: tracker implementation binary,
- tracker: tracker implementation library,
- tracker-protocol: peer to tracker protocol.

## State

TODO

## Setup

* Run `bash setup.sh`

## Usage

* Run `bash watch.sh`,
* Open `localhost:8080`,
* Open the browser console to read log messages,
* If necessary, edit the server address and other parameters,
* Ð¡lick the button `Connect to server`,
* To share files:
